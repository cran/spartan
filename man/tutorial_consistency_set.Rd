\title{Example dataset showing the structure for consistency analysis data}
\format{A list with 9060 rows and four columns}
\usage{
data(tutorial_consistency_set)
}
\description{
This dataset contains exemplar results from a consistency analysis, that
shown in the tutorial. This data can be read in and processed using the
functions detailed in the vignette. The important thing to obtain from this
object is the structure the data is expected to be in
